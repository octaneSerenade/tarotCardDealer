# tarotCardDealer
Lets you have a set of tarot cards dealt, for fortune and fun, written in JavaScript.

This is a fun little project, inspired by a career path by Codecademy.

When the programm is run, three randomized cards are spread, telling you the past, the present, and the future. Keep in mind that this is just for fun and not an *actual* promise, what the future holds.

Like a real, physical card deck, picked cards get deleted from the pool, so that you can never have the same card twice per spread.

I plan to expand this project in the future with user inputs and different spreads to choose from. Moreover, the card pool will be expanded.

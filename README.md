# Tarot Card Dealer
Lets you have a set of tarot cards dealt for fortune and fun, written in JavaScript.

This is a fun little project inspired by a career path on Codecademy.

When the program is run, three randomized cards are spread, telling you the past, the present, and the future. Keep in mind that this is just for fun and not an *actual* promise of what the future holds.

Like a real, physical card deck, picked cards get removed from the pool, so you can never have the same card twice per spread.

I plan to expand this project in the future with user inputs and different spreads to choose from. Moreover, the card pool will be expanded.
